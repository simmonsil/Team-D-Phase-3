            <h2>Plants Make People Happy</h2>
            <p>
                This simple idea was the seed for what would become Grounded in Greenery. We want to be the one destination for all things plants.
                We wanted to have an online plant store for people that wanted indoor plants of all shapes and sizes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Plants make us happier, healthier, more efficient and boost our creativity. They even clean the air we breath. We don't get much time to be around nature anymore so why not bring the nature to you.
            </p>
            <h2>Grounded in Greenery</h2>
            <p>
                Grounded in Greenery was formed by Seanna Bailey. Her love of plants drove her to collect them and enjoy all the positive qualities of them. She wanted to share that joy with others so she formed Grounded in Greenery to help share the joy of plants with all those that would visit the site. Grounded in Greenery allows you to shop and pick plants that fit your personality and lifestyle with just a few clicks of a button.
